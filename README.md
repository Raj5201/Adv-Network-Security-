This file consists of .gns3 file and the documentation that shows the steps of implementation 
Honestly, there were no configuration scripts used anywhere in this project. Everything was completed manually through the pfSense GUI, GNS3 interface, and normal commands inside the VMs. We built the entire network topology in GNS3 by hand, assigned the pfSense interfaces manually (WAN/LAN/OPT1), configured DHCP, firewall rules, NAT, OpenVPN, and Suricata entirely through the pfSense web dashboard. The VMs (Kali, Windows, Ubuntu DMZ) were also configured manually with static/DHCP IPs, routes, and connectivity tests.
All the testing like pings, nmap scans, brute-force attempts, and Suricata alert verification was done using direct terminal commands in Kali and Ubuntu, and screenshots were taken manually. So overall, the project didn’t require any automated configs or scripts; it was fully implemented through step-by-step manual setup, which is exactly how firewall, IDS/IPS, and VPN labs are normally completed in GNS3
For this project, the VMs were using dynamic (DHCP) IPs, not static. pfSense was running the DHCP server on both the LAN (192.168.10.0/24) and the DMZ (192.168.20.0/24), so Kali, Windows, and Ubuntu all received their addresses automatically. The only static IPs in the setup were the pfSense interface IPs: LAN = 192.168.10.1 and OPT1/DMZ = 192.168.20.1. All other machines got their IPs dynamically from pfSense.
